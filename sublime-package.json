V is a concrete value such as an int,\nstruct or pointer, never an interface itself, and has type T. For\ninstance, if we store the int value 3 in an interface, the\nresulting interface value has, schematically, (T=int, V=3). The\nvalue V is also known as the interface's dynamic value, since a\ngiven interface variable might hold different values V (and\ncorresponding types T) during the execution of the program.\n\nAn interface value is nil only if the V and T are both\nunset, (T=nil, V is not set), In particular, a nil interface will\nalways hold a nil type. If we store a nil pointer of type *int\ninside an interface value, the inner type will be *int regardless\nof the value of the pointer: (T=*int, V=nil). Such an interface\nvalue will therefore be non-nil even when the pointer value V\ninside is nil.\n\nThis situation can be confusing, and arises when a nil value is\nstored inside an interface value such as an error return:\n\n    func returnsError() error {\n        var p *MyError = nil\n        if bad() {\n            p = ErrBad\n        }\n        return p // Will always return a non-nil error.\n    }\n\nIf all goes well, the function returns a nil p, so the return\nvalue is an error interface value holding (T=*MyError, V=nil).\nThis means that if the caller compares the returned error to nil,\nit will always look as if there was an error even if nothing bad\nhappened. To return a proper nil error to the caller, the\nfunction must return an explicit nil:\n\n    func returnsError() error {\n        if bad() {\n            return ErrBad\n        }\n        return nil\n    }\n\nIt's a good idea for functions that return errors always to use\nthe error type in their signature (as we did above) rather than a\nconcrete type such as *MyError, to help guarantee the error is\ncreated correctly. As an example, os.Open returns an error even\nthough, if not nil, it's always of concrete type *os.PathError.\n\nSimilar situations to those described here can arise whenever\ninterfaces are used. Just keep in mind that if any concrete value\nhas been stored in the interface, the interface will not be nil.\nFor more information, see The Laws of\nReflection at https://golang.org/doc/articles/laws_of_reflection.html.\n\nThis text has been copied from\nhttps://golang.org/doc/faq#nil_error, licensed under the Creative\nCommons Attribution 3.0 License.\n\nAvailable since\n    2020.2\n",

However, these problems are generally\ntrivial to fix. We regard any modernizer whose fix changes program\nbehavior to have a serious bug and will endeavor to fix it.\n\nTo apply all modernization fixes en masse, you can use the\nfollowing command:\n\n\t$ go run golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/modernize/cmd/modernize@latest -fix -test ./...\n\n(Do not use \"go get -tool\" to add gopls as a dependency of your\nmodule; gopls commands must be built from their release branch.)\n\nIf the tool warns of conflicting fixes, you may need to run it more\nthan once until it has applied all fixes cleanly. This command is\nnot an officially supported interface and may change in the future.\n\nChanges produced by this tool should be reviewed as usual before\nbeing merged. In some cases, a loop may be replaced by a simple\nfunction call, causing comments within the loop to be discarded.\nHuman judgment may be required to avoid losing comments of value.\n\nEach diagnostic reported by modernize has a specific category. (The\ncategories are listed below.) Diagnostics in some categories, such\nas \"efaceany\" (which replaces \"interface{}\" with \"any\" where it is\nsafe to do so) are particularly numerous. It may ease the burden of\ncode review to apply fixes in two passes, the first change\nconsisting only of fixes of category \"efaceany\", the second\nconsisting of all others. This can be achieved using the -category flag:\n\n\t$ modernize -category=efaceany  -fix -test ./...\n\t$ modernize -category=-efaceany -fix -test ./...\n\nCategories of modernize diagnostic:\n\n  - forvar: remove x := x variable declarations made unnecessary by the new semantics of loops in go1.22.\n\n  - slicescontains: replace 'for i, elem := range s { if elem == needle { ...; break }'\n    by a call to slices.Contains, added in go1.21.\n\n  - minmax: replace an if/else conditional assignment by a call to\n    the built-in min or max functions added in go1.21.\n\n  - sortslice: replace sort.Slice(x, func(i, j int) bool) { return s[i] < s[j] }\n    by a call to slices.Sort(s), added in go1.21.\n\n  - efaceany: replace interface{} by the 'any' type added in go1.18.\n\n  - mapsloop: replace a loop around an m[k]=v map update by a call\n    to one of the Collect, Copy, Clone, or Insert functions from\n    the maps package, added in go1.21.\n\n  - fmtappendf: replace []byte(fmt.Sprintf...) by fmt.Appendf(nil, ...),\n    added in go1.19.\n\n  - testingcontext: replace uses of context.WithCancel in tests\n    with t.Context, added in go1.24.\n\n  - omitzero: replace omitempty by omitzero on structs, added in go1.24.\n\n  - bloop: replace \"for i := range b.N\" or \"for range b.N\" in a\n    benchmark with \"for b.Loop()\", and remove any preceding calls\n    to b.StopTimer, b.StartTimer, and b.ResetTimer.\n\n    B.Loop intentionally defeats compiler optimizations such as\n    inlining so that the benchmark is not entirely optimized away.\n    Currently, however, it may cause benchmarks to become slower\n    in some cases due to increased allocation; see\n    https://go.dev/issue/73137.\n\n  - rangeint: replace a 3-clause \"for i := 0; i < n; i++\" loop by\n    \"for i := range n\", added in go1.22.\n\n  - stringsseq: replace Split in \"for range strings.Split(...)\" by go1.24's\n    more efficient SplitSeq, or Fields with FieldSeq.\n\n  - stringscutprefix: replace some uses of HasPrefix followed by TrimPrefix with CutPrefix,\n    added to the strings package in go1.20.\n\n  - waitgroup: replace old complex usages of sync.WaitGroup by less complex WaitGroup.Go method in go1.25.",

Consider a balanced\ntree of N nodes. Iterating the root node will cause All to be\ncalled once on every node of the tree. This results in a chain of\nnested active range-over-func statements when yield(t.value) is\ncalled on a leaf node.\n\nThe first performance problem is that each range-over-func\nstatement must typically heap-allocate a variable, so iteration of\nthe tree allocates as many variables as there are elements in the\ntree, for a total of O(N) allocations, all unnecessary.\n\nThe second problem is that each call to yield for a leaf of the\ntree causes each of the enclosing range loops to receive a value,\nwhich they then immediately pass on to their respective yield\nfunction. This results in a chain of log(N) dynamic yield calls per\nelement, a total of O(N*log N) dynamic calls overall, when only\nO(N) are necessary.\n\nA better implementation strategy for recursive iterators is to\nfirst define the \"every\" operator for your recursive data type,\nwhere every(f) reports whether f(x) is true for every element x in\nthe data type. For our tree, the every function would be:\n\n\tfunc (t *tree) every(f func(int) bool) bool {\n\t\treturn t == nil ||\n\t\t\tt.left.every(f) && f(t.value) && t.right.every(f)\n\t}\n\nThen the iterator can be simply expressed as a trivial wrapper\naround this function:\n\n\tfunc (t *tree) All() iter.Seq[int] {\n\t\treturn func(yield func(int) bool) {\n\t\t\t_ = t.every(yield)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nIn effect, tree.All computes whether yield returns true for each\nelement, short-circuiting if it every returns false, then discards\nthe final boolean result.\n\nThis has much better performance characteristics: it makes one\ndynamic call per element of the tree, and it doesn't heap-allocate\nanything.
